# MATRIX-Lite-JS

MATRIX Lite NFC JS is an npm package that allows users of varying skill levels to easily program NFC with their MATRIX Creator. This repository will be unstable while we test different methods of porting HAL NFC to JavaScript.

# Roadmap
- waiting for [HAL NFC](https://github.com/matrix-io/matrix-hal-nfc) to be finished/polished.
